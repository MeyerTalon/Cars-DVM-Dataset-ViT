# Cars-DVM-Dataset-ViT
A fun implementation of the Vision Transformer model trained to classify cars using the DVM-Cars-Dataset.

I achieved a 44% test accuracy using only 0.35% of the total dataset. I could only use such a small subset due to the restrictions on GPU training in the Google Colab free tier. I'm confident that the test accuracy would drastically improve with a higher sample size. Furthermore, I noticed that most the errors that resulted in misclassification were minor ones, for instance missclassify an 2018 BMW m4 as a 2017 BMW m4.
